# The 5th BIU Winter School

 

# ADVANCES IN PRACTICAL MULTIPARTY COMPUTATION

## FEBRUARY 15-19, 2015

### SCHOOL OVERVIEW

In the setting of secure multiparty computation, two or more parties with private inputs wish to compute some joint function of their inputs. The security requirements of such a computation are privacy (meaning that the parties learn the output and nothing more), correctness (meaning that the output is correctly distributed), independence of inputs, and more. This setting encompasses computations as simple as coin-tossing and agreement, and as complex as electronic voting, electronic auctions, electronic cash schemes, anonymous transactions, and private information retrieval schemes. Due to its generality, secure computation is a central tool in cryptography.

Secure multiparty computation has been advancing in leaps and bounds in recent years, and is now at a state where many problems arising in practice can be solved. In this winter school, we will study the major techniques and state-of-the-art protocols for practical two-party and multiparty computation. The first day of the school will begin with tutorials for those not familiar with the basics of secure computation. This material can also be viewed from the [1st BIU winter school](http://cyber.biu.ac.il/event/the-1st-biu-winter-school/) (the [first](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3U-5mf6hGw), [second](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtKCDJe4a48), [third](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiCv9qGn_8M), [fourth](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwsmG3S9wIc) and [fifth](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XT_MQGWp904) lectures are recommended). The aim of the school is to start from the basics, and teach the material needed to bring the participants up to date with the latest results in this exciting field. The last day of the school will be a mini-workshop where latest results will be presented.

The school program includes approximately 27 hours of lectures and a half-day excursion to Jerusalem.

The target audience for the school is graduate students and postdocs in cryptography (we will assume that participants have taken at least one university-level course in cryptography). However, all faculty, undergrads and professionals *with the necessary background* are welcome. The winter school is open to participants from all over the world; all talks will be in English.
