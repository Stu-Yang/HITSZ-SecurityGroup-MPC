# The 9th BIU Winter School on Cryptography

## Zero Knowledge

### February 18-21, 2019

### **School Overview**

Zero knowledge is a fundamental tool of cryptography, in both theory and practice. It enables a party to prove an assertion without revealing anything but the fact that it is indeed true. The theory of zero-knowledge proofs has beautiful connections to complexity and is used to prove many basic theoretical results of cryptography. In addition, efficient zero-knowledge proofs have many applications, including efficient secure computation, advanced authentication schemes like anonymous credentials, transaction validation, and more.

In the 9th BIU Winter School on Cryptography, we will study the theory and practice of zero-knowledge proofs. The program will cover definitional issues and constructions. The following topics will be included:

1) Foundations of zero-knowledge: motivation and definitions, zero-knowledge for NP, witness indistinguishability, constant-round arguments and proofs, non-interactive zero-knowledge, the Fiat-Shamir paradigm, lower bounds and limitations, and non-black-box zero-knowledge.

2) Sigma protocols

3) MPC in the head

4) Zero knowledge and non-interactive zero-knowledge from Bilinear maps

5) Short zero knowledge: SNARKs and STARKs

The winter school program is designed to teach the topic from its basics up to the latest research. The target audience for the school is graduate students and postdocs in cryptography (we will assume that participants have taken at least one university-level course in cryptography). However, all faculty, undergrads and professionals *with the necessary background* are welcome. The winter school is open to participants from all over the world; all talks will be in English.
